# Data Science Salaries

## Description
How much do data scientists make? Data science has been ranked as one of the 'sexiest' jobs of the past decade, so what does that translate to financially? To answer this question we use H-1B salary data to explore the salaries of data scientists at different companies across the US.

This notebook continues, and extends the work by Tony Yiu, whose article can be found at: https://towardsdatascience.com/how-much-do-data-scientists-make-cbd7ec2b458.

## Findings
First, we can see that starting in 2014, the job title of "data scientist" really started to expand.

But, even though there's been explosive growth in the number of data scientists, we can see that salaries have remained fairly constant.

Here's the distribution of salaries:

There's also fairly high variance in salary, and number of data scientists by company.

Big tech companies offer the best compensation.
